# Jumpstart GDPR compliance using Office 365 and Point Taken 
 
On January the 24, Point Taken held a breakfast seminar in Kristiansand, focusing on the use of Office 365 integrated Security & Compliance center.  
This morning we showed the participants how Office 365 allows them to easily find, classify, retain or delete personal (custom) sensitive data to comply with the upcoming GDPR regulations, which will come into force on May 25 2018. 
In addition, we demonstrated how Office 365 allows us to create GDPR policies avoiding loss of sensitive data and how we can customize the out-of-the box tools to meet other than GDPR regulations (company specific policies).

Many were surprised to see how much functionality Office 365 offers, that can be used against documents, emails and files stored in Outlook, OneDrive for Business and SharePoint.  
We also demonstrated that the same tools can be used to analyze data stored in traditional file servers as well, extending the range of benefits.  
 
Quite a few admitted this morning, that they donâ€™t use Office 365 so far, and only had recently started their journey towards GDPR compliance.  
 
Point Taken is pleased to offer a unique approach for you to enable you to gain immediate benefits at a limited cost. You can decide on what way and how much you want to extend the proof of concept after having experienced the power of Office 365.  

#### How it works:

* Point Taken will set up a free Office 365 trial tenant for you with 25 fully functional E5 licenses 
* Together with you, we will build search criteria that define personal and other sensitive data. We can also move a limited number of files into Office 365 and/or use on-premise file storage 
* We will use the Office 365 Security & Compliance Centre to conduct searches, architecture and apply information protection and monitor and prevent for leaks 
* Proper training will be provided to enable you to continue using the tools 
* Point Taken will also explain the other functions and benefits you get when using Office 365 
* After 30 days you can decide to discontinue the proof of concept or to convert the trial tenant into a continuous Office 365 environment with the required number of licenses 
* Should more data be moved from on-premise into Office 365 we can also assist with that 
* The proof of concept can be obtained for a limited investment. Existing Office 365 customers can also benefit from this approach.
* Pricing can be obtained at a simple request.
